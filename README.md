## 🔍 How It Works

TransferX utilizes a peer-to-peer (P2P) network for file sharing:

1. The sender selects a file to share.
2. TransferX generates a unique share ID and QR code.
3. The recipient scans the QR code or uses the provided link.
4. A direct P2P connection is established between sender and recipient.
5. The file is transferred directly, without passing through any central servers.
